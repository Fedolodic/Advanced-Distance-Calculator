# Advanced Distance Calculator

*Goal*: To calculate the distance between two points and how long it would take to travel between them.

1. Ask the user to enter distance traveled in miles
2. Use input validation for miles where `miles < 0`
3. Verify user entered correct number for miles
4. Ask the user to enter time taken in hours
5. Use input validation for time where `hours < 0`
6. Verify user entered correct time
7. Calculate speed
    - mph, `miles/hour`
    - Calculate kph, `mph*1.60934`
    - Calculate Î¼ly/m, `kph*((1*10^12)/(5.6766*10^7))`
10. Display speeds
